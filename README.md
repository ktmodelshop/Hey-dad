This project is to feature a wearable device that detects vertical movement and, at some preset relative height, triggers an audible (verbal) warning to wait for assistance, or, to return to a seated position. This is to caution those with problems of instability, generally in an institutional setting.  I've been working on this for quite a while. I recently put together a prototype using a LADYBUG board (STM32L432) and a TDK ICP-10100 pressure sensor on a i2c buss. Works beutifully as long as the environment is quiet. I'd like to try using another ICP_10100 as a control on the same buss line but can't find a distinctive address for each one. Adrian Studer would know how to do this and wish he would help. Ralph
